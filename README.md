# Drone Monitoring and Control System using a Cloud Platform

This project implements a real-time tracking and management system for a drone using a cloud-based interface. The drone integrates GPS, camera, and sensor data, which is transmitted to the cloud for live monitoring, analysis, and control. Users can set flight paths, track the drone's location, and access data from anywhere using a mobile app or web dashboard.

## Components:
1. **Drone Device:** GPS, camera, and sensor data integration.
2. **Cloud Platform:** Storing data and providing an interface for controlling and tracking the drone.
3. **Mobile App:** A mobile app for real-time monitoring and control of the drone.

## Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi / Arduino for drone control
- Python for cloud integration
- Cloud API (e.g., AWS, Firebase, or custom cloud server)
- React Native / Flutter for the mobile app

## Instructions:
1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Upload the drone code to Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
3. Set up the cloud API and integrate it with the mobile app.
4. Run the mobile app to start monitoring the drone.
